# So_Long
The idea is to create a 2D game with the help of the minilibX and X11 graphic server. The player has to collect the "collectibles" before he can leave the map through the exit(s). The map is a file ".ber" loaded as an argument of the executable. The number of moves are counted and the goal is to join the exit with the minimum number of moves.

How to compil and run the game

For clone :
type "git clone https://github.com/YusufAnilTurgut/so_long.git"

For compile :
type "make"

For run : 
./so_long ./maps/map1.ber

You can change the map by changing the map1.ber file.
1 is Wall, 0 is ground, P is player, C is coin, E is exit. 
If map is not finishable, map cannot open.
